              <h1>The Skinny</h1>
              <p>
                No Limit Agency has a beautiful website with a lot of personality 
                featuring great photography, enertaining video elements, and quality content.  
                That being said, there's always room for improvement.  In this case study 
                we're going to take a look at how this site could be modified to improve 
                user experience and drive client interaction.  To do that, we'll 
                be exploring a few key points:
                <br><br>
                  •	Driving client communication through ease-of-use
                  <br>
                  •	Optimizing load times to avoid user drop-off 
                  <br>
                  •	Improving navigation to enhance user experience
                <br><br>
                Let's dive in -- 
              </p>
              
              <h1>Driving Communication</h1>
              <p>
                The primary focus of any company site is, of course, to entice clients and generate business.  To accomplish that, we need to make it as easy as possible for users to let us know that they want to work with us. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently the 'Contact' button is located in two places on the No Limit site: the top right corner of the page, second to the 'Cheat Sheet' link, and at the bottom right corner of the page, inside the footer.  When dealing with navigation links, about <a href='https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/web-design-standards/'>44%</a> of websites have their contact button in the very top right corner of the page.  We can utilize this design convention to make it easier for users to find the contact button, since it will be in a location that they expect.  
              </p>
              <p>
                My recommendation here would be to make the 'Cheat Sheet' link smaller, and to remove the text from the top of that icon altogether, making it just the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button'>'hamburger' icon</a>.  This icon is so synonymous with 'menu' now that having it labelled isn't fully necessary.  This will position the 'Contact' link more closely to the top right corner, making it more easily found.
              </p>
              <p>
                Styling is also very important - right now the 'Contact' link is in the exact same styling as the other navigation links (bold, white, all caps).  We really want the contact link to stand out, and we can easily do that by adding a contrast color or making it a <a href='https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/buttons/'>full blown button</a> with a bright background color.  Including this bit of color would make the link impossible to miss, since most of the site is in black and white.
              </p>
              <p>
                The case studies are a great place to put a call to action - they show the user the value in our services, so we should strike while the iron is hot and include a full contact form at the bottom of each one with a header to the effect of 'Like what you see?'.  This way the user can reach us right then and there, no mouse click and no load times.  A variation of this idea is to simply add the contact form right into the footer of every page.
              </p>
              
              <h1>Optimizing Load Times</h1>
              <p>
                The first thing any user will notice when going to the No Limit site is the stunning photography.  These photos make the site visually appealing, but can negatively impact user experience (and thereby drive away potential clients) by creating long load times.  In my experience, loading <a href='http://nolimitagency.com/the-why/'>'The Why' page</a> took anywhere from 5-8 seconds from click to fully loaded page.  It may not sound like much, but studies show that people now have an attention span of <a href='http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/'>about eight seconds</a>, so we're kind of pushing it here.  Not to mention that about <a href='https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/'>40% of users will abandon a web site</a> if it takes longer than three seconds to load. The current load time puts this page in the bottom 24% of sites tested, according to pingdom.com's <a href='https://tools.pingdom.com/#!/cJIDsS/http://nolimitagency.com/the-why/'>speed testing tool</a>.              </p>
              <p>
                The main culprits here are (of course) the photos -- currently accounting for about 53% of the total load time.  These images should be optimized for web by reducing overall resolution and compressing the image as much as possible without sacrificing quality (something <a href='https://madebysidecar.com/journal/optimizing-images-for-the-web-in-photoshop'>easily done in Photoshop</a>).  Another solution would be to implement <a href='https://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/enabled_fadein.html'>lazy-loading</a>, using a script to only load images when the user scrolls down to them, drastically reducing initial load times.               </p>
              <p>
                Which brings us to my next topic: script loading, which accounts for about 36% of the total load time.  Currently the page loads <strong>53</strong> individual JavaScript files, which is a <strong>lot</strong>.  To give you a frame of reference, <a href='http://royal.pingdom.com/2008/11/05/load-size-analysis-of-the-top-100-blogs/'>Pingdom.com</a> lists the average number of scripts per page as only 9 for the top 100 blogs, six times less than what we have on the No Limit site.  We can improve load times here by auditing and removing any unnecessary or unused scripts and condensing the remaining scripts into a smaller number of files.              </p>
              <p>
                One more recommendation in the family of load times is to remove unnecessary page loads.  Right now to read a case study you need to navigate to the case studies main page, navigate the carousel of studies, and click on the one you want. Essentially this then loads the same page just with the case study text beneath the carousel.  While this isn't a <em>huge</em> deal, it's one more page load before we actually get to the content we want.  To remedy this, I recommend removing the main case studies landing page altogether and replacing it with the first case study page, including all of the content for that case study.  The carousel up top would stay the same (no automatic slide movement), allowing the user to click through case studies as they please.              </p>
              <p>
                The last thing we want is for potential clients to be driven away simply because they don't have the attention span to wait for a page to load, so optimizing load times is crucial in increasing visitor conversion.              </p>
              </p>
              
              <h1>Improving Navigation</h1>
              <p>
                A whopping <a href='https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/web-design-standards/'>88%</a> of sites have a horizontal nav bar at the top of the page - making it a web design standard.  In my opinion this is one standard that's ok to break.  While No Limit does have a nav bar of sorts at the very top of the page, the main navigation elements are centered vertically in the full-screen <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_image'>hero image</a>.  I think this works well with the design of the site, but could use some small tweaks.                
              </p>
              <p>
                The main problem here is that once a user scrolls down, they no longer have access to any navigational links.  One quick fix is to add some kind of <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/'>sticky navigation</a> (maybe just by using fixed positioning on the 'Cheat Sheet' link to keep it in the top right at all times).  Alternatively, we could simply add a 'scroll to top' button once the user scrolls past the nav links.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The navigation should also be consistent to save the user from any confusion while clicking around.  Currently the wording of the links is totally different between the 'Cheat Sheet' menu and the main links in the hero image, even though they link to the same locations.  We should make the links match and structure them in the same way (for example, if 'Services' is the second link in the hero image, it should be the second link in the Cheat Sheet).              
              </p>
              
              <h1>Conclusion</h1>
              <p>
                The No Limit site is beautiful, responsive, and overall very well designed, but could benefit from a few small tweaks to improve user experience.  By driving communication through the contact us form, decreasing load times, and improving navigation, we can ensure that we aren't losing any potential clients due to poor user experience, and therefor driving up our visitor-to-client conversion.
